                        <p>
                            <b>Sports:</b> I enjoy watching a variety of sports, including: NBA, NFL, EPL, and MLB.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Music:</b> Listening to and playing music are some of my favorite ways to pass time. One of my active side 
                            projects relies on the Spotify API and enables the user to explore what they listen to and attempt to find new music.

                                building a website to expose the features a bit and to allow users a way to find new music and learn more about
                                what they have been consuming.

                                the initial deployment.
