                        Through 9 years of building software to solve a variety of problems, I have evolved into a full-stack engineer with a focus
                        on backend services who also enjoys working in DevOps.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        As time has passed I have developed a healthy addiction to learning and frequently seek out new 
                        challenges in an attempt to add to my toolbox.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        I love helping others learn and I have over 10 years of tutoring experience doing so.

                     <p>
                        Team process is something I have found to be crucial to the success of a team and I frequently find myself reflecting
                        on how my team is currently operating and suggesting improvements when necessary.

                        Some of my personal interests:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Sports:</b> I enjoy watching a variety of sports, including: NBA, NFL, EPL, and MLB. Frequently, I will attempt to
                        combine my interests and I have recently been working on an app to suggest sports bets based on aggregated information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Music:</b> Listening to and playing music are some of my favorite ways to pass time. Another one of my active side 
                        projects relies on the Spotify API and enables the user to explore what they listen to and attempt to find new music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Outdoors:</b> Snowboarding, skateboarding, hiking, and camping are some of my favorite outdoor activites. It 
                        doesn't take much to get me outside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Houseplants:</b> This started by me purchasing one succulent and has now snowballed into me supporting over 20 plants.
                        My favorites are a 3 year old fiddle-leaf fig and my army of jades.

                        <li>
                            <b>(Untitled Spotify Project):</b> Spotify provides some interesting functionality via REST API.  I have been
                            building a website to expose the features a bit and to allow users a way to find new music and learn more about
                            what they have been consuming.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>WallStreetBets Tracker:</b> I am writing a script that I have scheduled to monitor what is being posted on the 
                            Reddit forum WallStreetBets. The point is to keep track of what stocks are being talked about and how often and
                            alert when something might be gaining in popularity.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>(abandoned) Pet Tracker:</b> Last fall I was lucky enough to be able to add a Beagle puppy to my home. I also had a close
                            friend of mine reach out to me with some interest in learning more about web development so I started this project
                            as a way to help him learn while also being able to track certain events related to my new puppy (potty breaks,
                            eat times, treat times, accidents, etc).
